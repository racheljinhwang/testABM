Additional assignment - AverageTravelTimePerMode.csv

Task: Extend the CalculateAverageTravelTime event handler to compute the average travel time of each mode during simulation and generate a csv file (AverageTravelTimePerMode.csv) with this information
This means that you would need to use the controler listener as shown in the class examples.
There are many ways to do this. One way is to get the departure time, mode, and arrival time from a PersonDepartureEvent and PersonArrivalEvent
Calculate the duration for each mode and get the average

Looking forward to your implementations next class!
